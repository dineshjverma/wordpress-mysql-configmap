#Multi-Tier Application for WordPress and MySQL using ConfigMaps

This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive solution for deploying a multi-tier application consisting of WordPress as the frontend and MySQL as the backend. The deployment leverages Kubernetes ConfigMaps to manage environment variables, ensuring secure and scalable deployment of the application.

The application architecture is designed to separate the frontend (WordPress) and backend (MySQL) components, enabling efficient management and scaling of each tier independently. The following environment variables are utilized to configure the application:

#MySQL Configuration:

**MYSQL_PASSWORD**: The password used to access the MySQL database (in this case, set to "**alexa**").
**MYSQL_DATABASE**: The name of the MySQL database (here, set to "**unnati**").

#WordPress Configuration:

**WORDPRESS_DB_HOST**: The host address for connecting to the MySQL backend (configured as "**mysql.backend.svc.cluster.local**").
**WORDPRESS_DB_USER**: The username for the MySQL database connection (set as "****root****").
**WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD**: The password for the MySQL database connection (also set as "**alexa**").
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: The name of the MySQL database for WordPress (here, set to "**unnati**").
By leveraging these environment variables, the application achieves secure communication between the frontend and backend tiers. The ConfigMaps feature of Kubernetes ensures easy management and modification of these variables, allowing for seamless deployment and customization of the application.

This GitHub repository provides a structured and well-documented approach to deploying the multi-tier WordPress and MySQL application. It includes all the necessary configuration files, scripts, and deployment manifests required to set up the application in a Kubernetes cluster. With the provided instructions, users can easily adapt and customize the deployment to fit their specific requirements.

By utilizing this repository, developers and system administrators can streamline the deployment process, saving time and effort while ensuring a reliable and scalable environment for hosting WordPress-based applications with MySQL as the backend database.
